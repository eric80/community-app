/**
 * Style of the Join Now button.
 *
 * IMPRORTANT: The way it is done now is not good: we are supposed to use the
 * standard themeable button here; the problem is that JoinCommunity component
 * was implemented without it; to speed-up development; thus it also should be
 * properly updated, and we don't have time right now.
