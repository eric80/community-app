                  Some of the most talented and qualified coders in the world
                  are veterans and active military personnel. The US military
                  has some of the most sophisticated technology platforms and
                  equipment on the planet, which demand the brightest minds
                  available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their training and skills help them protect our country from
                  threats. Now, organizations and businesses can benefit from
                  their experience and expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With 250,000 service members exiting the military annually,
                  they need to find opportunities in civilian employment.

                  Topcoder recognizes the invaluable experience our veterans
                  and military service members gain during their service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet, there’s often a gap that exists in translating this
                  experience to civilian employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A study by the nonprofit research group, Center for New
                  American Security, reports that 60% of employers see the
                  translation gap as the biggest obstacle to bringing more vets
                  on board.

                  We’ve partnered with OperationCode, a 503(c) advocacy group
                  dedicated to helping veterans learn to code, to assist in
                  bridging the gap between real-world skills and a career
                  in technology as well as promote this platform.

                  a career in technology into viable job opportunities, which
                  can be difficult to obtain without showing direct experience
                  with private sector toolsets.

                  The technology sector will only continue grow. Technology
                  changes rapidly and is a key component of any industry from
                  banking to manufacturing to retail.

                <p>
                  Software developers aren’t just needed for companies whose
                  main focus is software, they’re needed to keep many industries
                  on pace with competitors, delivering the options and
                  experiences their clients needs - but there’s a major talent
                  gap.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More than half of global IT leaders predict they will face a
                  lack of IT talent in the next year, as new technology demands
                  outpace the talent supply, according to a new study from
                  Brocade, which surveyed 630 IT leaders in the U.S., U.K.,
                  France, Germany, Australia and Singapore.
