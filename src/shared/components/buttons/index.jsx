/**
 * The new standard button component to be used all around.
 *
 * This module defines a standard button, which is rendered as a standard HTML
 * <button> element, either as react-router <Link>, or as HTML <a>, depending on
 * the props passed in.
 *
 * The button uses react-css-super-themr for styling, and it is exported
 * mupltiple
 * times, differently wrapped with react-css-super-themr decorator. The intent
 * behind
 * it is to provide a standard button implementation, which can be easily styled
 * according to the context of use. E.g. in new pages of the main Topcoder site
 * the design assumes that primary buttons are colored with the colors of
 * competition track to which the page relates. react-css-super-themr allows to
 * wrap entire page into ThemeProvider which overrides the styling of all
 * PrimaryButton instances in the page; it still allows to further customise
 * each of these buttons passing theme object directly into each button
 * (the theme passed this way is merged with the one provided by ThemeProvider).
 * Standard button themes are provided as separate SCSS stylesheets along with
 * this JSX file.
 * 
 * Decision between <button>, <Link>, and <a> is done in the following way:
 *
 * 1. If "to" prop is passed into button, then either <Link> or <a> is used,
 *    according with the rules established in "utils/router" (basically, <Link>
 *    is used for links within the same domain, assuming we are not leaving the
 *    app, and do not want to reload it, <a> is used otherwise; also <a> can be
 *    enforced by "enforceA" and "openNewTab" props);
 * 
 * 2. Otherwise <button> is used.
 * 
 * NOTE: As our <Link> implementation is, technically, a container, Button
 * needs access to Redux store. It is automatically handled behind the scene
 * in the main code, though in the snapshot tests you should take care about
 * providing a mock Redux store to a ReactJS sub-tree containing these buttons.
 *
 * NOTE: Such link-related properties as "enforceA", "openNewTab", and "replace"
 * take no effect when the button is rendered as <button> (i.e. when "to" prop
 * is not provided).
